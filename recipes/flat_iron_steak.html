    <h2>What Is Flat Iron Steak?</h2>
    <p>Flat iron steak is cut from beef shoulder. To make a flat iron steak, butchers remove the connective tissue to separate the top shoulder blade into two cuts: One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron.
       <br><br>Flat iron steak is nicely marbled and is less expensive than other steaks, which makes it a popular choice among home cooks. When it's cooked correctly, flat iron steak is wonderfully tender and juicy.</p>

       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
           <li>1 (2lbs) flat iron steak</li>
           <li>2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
           <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
           <li>1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
           <li>1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh chives</li>
           <li>1/4 cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)</li>
           <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
           <li>3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
           <li>1/4 teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</li><br>
